      - paragraph
      - paragraph [ref=e28]: "When you are looking into a career of a software engineer, this algorithm is very much essential for cracking a coding interview. As you know, most of the top companies use this algorithm, including Facebook, Linkedln, Twitter, Youtube, Google. The most common scenario where graphs are useful include:"

        - listitem [ref=e31]: Representing Maps
      - paragraph [ref=e32]: Now you would have got an idea of graphs. Remember, how google maps show the map from your home to a destination. There you go! It is GRAPH. Just like, how you can see a post that you posted on Facebook in 2010 in seconds. Yes, it is GRAPH.
      - paragraph [ref=e33]: "The diagrammatic representation is for humans to understand. But what about computers? How can Computers understand this graph? For that, we have different representation of graphs:"
      - paragraph [ref=e34]: "There are different ways to optimally represent a graph, depending on the density of its edges, type of operations to be performed and ease of use. Most used graph representation include:"

        - strong [ref=e40]: "Adjacency Matrix:"
      - paragraph [ref=e41]:
        - text: An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of V x V vertices. Each row and column represent a vertex. If the value of any element a [i, j] = 1, this means there is an edge between those vertices. Directly connected vertices are known as
        - emphasis [ref=e42]: neighbor
        - text: ", or"
        - emphasis [ref=e43]: adjacent
        - text: "to one another. But this boolean representation varies based on the type of graph. Let’s create an adjacency matrix for the simple graph shown above:"
      - paragraph [ref=e44]
      - paragraph [ref=e45]: Since it is an undirected graph, for edge (A,B), we also need to mark edge (B,A) making the adjacency matrix symmetric about the diagonal.
      - paragraph [ref=e46]:
        - strong [ref=e47]: "Adjacency List:"
      - paragraph [ref=e48]: An Adjacency list represents graphs in an array of linked lists. The index of the array represents a vertex and each element in its linked list represents the other vertices that form an edge with the vertex. The size of the array is equal to the number of vertices.
      - paragraph [ref=e49]
      - paragraph [ref=e50]:
        - strong [ref=e51]: "Incidence Matrix:"
      - paragraph [ref=e52]: "In this graph representation, a graph G with vertices(V) and edges(E) is translated into a VxE matrix. Inside the matrix, we denote 1 if the vertex in the row and the edge in the column are connected, otherwise the value will be 0. Let us represent the simple graph in our example using Incidence Matrix:"
      - paragraph [ref=e53]: Here, you can see that all the column values when added will be 2. This is because there will always be two vertices connecting an edge.

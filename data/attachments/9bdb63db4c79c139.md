      - paragraph [ref=e26]: Time Complexity and Space complexity are the two metrics used to measure the efficiency of an algorithm in data Structures.

      - paragraph [ref=e28]: 1.speed
      - paragraph [ref=e29]: 2.Efficiency
      - paragraph [ref=e30]: We measure how efficient certain data measured at a different task such as
      - paragraph [ref=e31]: 1) insertion

      - paragraph [ref=e45]:
        - strong [ref=e46]: How does the time complexity equation works?
      - paragraph [ref=e47]: A Time Complexity equation works by inserting the size of the dataset as an integer n and returning the number of operations that need to be conducted by the computer before the function can finish
      - paragraph [ref=e48]: N= size of the dataset(no. of elements)
      - paragraph [ref=e49]: The worst-case scenario is used to judge.
      - paragraph [ref=e50]:
        - strong [ref=e51]: Why called as Big 'O'?
      - paragraph [ref=e52]: Big represents capital and O means order, as "order of complexity" as O(f(x))represents It consists of BIG 'O'. It is about finding an asymptotic upper bound.
      - paragraph [ref=e53]: "Types of time complexity eq:"
      - paragraph [ref=e54]: 1) O(1) - best means any large be the dataset, single operation or instruction is used
      - paragraph [ref=e55]: 2) O(N) - Linear algothrim
      - paragraph [ref=e56]: 3) O(log n) - fast completion time gets more efficient as the size of the data increases
      - paragraph [ref=e57]: "ex: Binary search"
      - paragraph [ref=e58]: 4) O(N log N)
      - paragraph [ref=e59]: 5) O(n2)
      - paragraph [ref=e60]: 6) O(2n)

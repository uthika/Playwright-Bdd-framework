      - paragraph [ref=e28]: What is a graph?
      - paragraph [ref=e29]: A Graph G is a non-linear data structure having a set of vertices (or nodes)(V) and edges(E) between vertices and it is represented as (V,E). It can have any number of edges and nodes and any node can be connected to any other node by an edge.
      - paragraph [ref=e30]
      - paragraph [ref=e31]: Above is the diagrammatic representation of a simple graph. Each circle here represents a node, and each line is the edge connecting the vertices.
      - paragraph [ref=e32]: "Here, the vertices and edges can be represented in a set. Vertices(V) are the nodes. In the above graph, vertices are:"
      - paragraph [ref=e33]: "V = {A, B, C, D, E}"
      - paragraph [ref=e34]: Edges are the connections between Vertices. We can represent E as
      - paragraph [ref=e35]: "E = {AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, BE, CD, DE} or E = {(A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,C), (B,D), (B,E), (C,D), (D,E)}"
      - paragraph [ref=e36]: "A simple graph is a graph with no loops and no parallel edges .The properties of simple graph can be defined as follows:"
      - list [ref=e37]:
        - listitem [ref=e38]: A simple graph must be an Undirected graph.
        - listitem [ref=e39]: A simple graph must be an Unweighted graph.
        - listitem [ref=e40]: A simple graph does not have loops and multiple edges.
